## Setup a Server with this modpack!

The quickest option is to download the server pack from [here](https://github.com/baddylan/j-and-f-mc-modpack/raw/main/Server%20Pack.zip)

### Alternative setup (Manaually install it.)

1. Download Minecraft Forge version 43.1.3 installer for Minecraft 1.19.2 from [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net)
2. Run the installer jar file you just downloaded.
3. Select 'Install Server' and be sure to change the directory to an empty one where it can install the server for you.
4. After installing the server, navigate to the directory it was just installed to.
5. Open a second window with the folder where you've installed the client-side instance of the modpack, and copy the `mods` and `config` directory to the server.
6. Navigate into the `mods` directory, and delete the jar files for the following mods: `BetterF3`, `Better Mod Buttons`, `Inventory Profiles Next`, `Oculus`, and `Rubidium` from the server, as they're client-side mods and some can prevent them from working.
7. Start up the server by running the `run.bat` for Windows, or if you're on Linux or macOS, use a terminal to run `./run.sh` in the server directory. If you've followed the instructions correctly, the server will start up and be ready to join after a minute or two.
